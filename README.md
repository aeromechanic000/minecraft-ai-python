Minecraft AI-Python is a modular framework designed to support the creation and customization of AI Characters (AICs) within Minecraft environments. It provides a stable and extensible interface for perception, action, communication, memory, and reflection‚Äîenabling complex individual and multi-agent behaviors.

ü¶æ Minecraft AI-Python is under development, more functions are added and optimized. If you have any question, welcome to join the our Discord server for more communications!

ü™á **Relationship between Minecraft AI-Python and Minecraft AI**

This project is part of the broader Minecraft AI ecosystem. While the original [Minecraft AI](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai) project focuses on a JavaScript-based infrastructure with integrated components, minecraft-ai-python emphasizes simplicity, flexibility, and rapid development in Python. It is ideal for educational experiments, prototyping research ideas, and custom agent development by individual contributors.

ü§ñ **Relationship between Minecraft AI and MINDcraft**

minecraft-ai shares many conceptual foundations with the [MINDCraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft) project introduced by Convex researchers‚Äîparticularly around planning, reflection, and social coordination in open-ended virtual environments. However, our approach prioritizes real-world usability and developer extensibility, with a special focus on:
    
- ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è A plugin-based mechanism for extending agent capabilities without modifying core logic
- üß™ A practical and cohesive framework that includes memory, reflection, and coordination modules

## üöÄ Quick Start 
This guide will walk you through setting up and running the `minecraft-ai-python` system. Make sure you have **Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1** installed and ready.

### Prerequisites

* **Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.1**
* **Node.js** and **npm**
* **Python 3.10** (Recommended: use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
* An API token from your preferred LLM provider (e.g., OpenRouter, etc.)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-python.git
cd minecraft-ai-python
```

### 2. Install Node Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note on Patch Files**
> If you need to apply custom patches to npm modules (e.g., based on the `/patches` folder), first modify the local files as needed, then run:

```bash
npx patch-package [package-name]
```

Patches will be automatically applied every time you run `npm install`.

### 3. Set Up Python Environment

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 using Anaconda:

```bash
conda create -n mc python=3.10
conda activate mc
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Minecraft

1. Open **Minecraft Java Edition**, version **1.21.1**
2. Create or load a world
3. Open the world to LAN using **port `55916`**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can use the ports other than `55916`, as long as it is open and match the `settings.json`.

### 5. Configure LLM Providers

Edit the `model.json` file to include your LLM provider token.

### 6. Start the Bot System

Once everything is configured, start the agent system:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see the AI agent(s) connect and say "Hi, I am [bot's name]!" within your Minecraft world!

## FAQs

### `ECONNRESET` Error with Code `-4077`

This error typically occurs when the `minecraft_version` specified in your `settings.json` file does not match the actual version of the Minecraft server you are running.

**Recommended Fix**

* Use **Minecraft Java Edition `1.21.1`**
* Ensure the `minecraft_version` field in `settings.json` exactly matches the version of your running Minecraft world:

```json
"minecraft_version": "1.21.1"
```
